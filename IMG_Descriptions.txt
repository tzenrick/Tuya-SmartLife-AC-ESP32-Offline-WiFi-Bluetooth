Images are varios angle of the current prototype.

A USB A Male breakout board is conneced to the VIN+ and VIN- of the voltage regulator.
The VOUT+ and VOUT- are connected to the ESP32-C3 on 5V and GND.
USB A pin2 is connected to ESP32 pin21, and USB A pin3 is connected to ESP32 pin20.

I promise, I cleaned off the flux after I saw these pictures.
